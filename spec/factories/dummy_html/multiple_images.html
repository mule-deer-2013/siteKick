<p>An interesting thing came up while working on my Sudoku solution. Part of what I had to do to get my desired result was take my @board variable (which, you guessed it, was the instance variable that I used to change and refer to my Sudoku board) and make a copy of it. In the first part of the Sudoku challenge, since we weren&#8217;t making any changes to the Sudoku puzzle unless we were absolutely <em>certain</em> that we had the correct answer, one persistent variable for the board was all that was necessary.</p>
<h2>Hey!</h2>
<h3>Seriously, hey!</h3>
<p>However, when guessing became involved, I decided it would be a good idea to duplicate the board, creating a &#8220;tempboard&#8221; variable that I could change, test, and discard or keep as necessary. Pretty straightforward, right? I figured it should look something like this:</p>
<pre>tempboard = @board.dup</pre>
<p>But then a Bad Thing happened. When I changed values in tempboard, things started breaking in @board—the exact thing I <em>didn&#8217;t</em> want to happen. Both boards featured triple-nested arrays; the board itself was an array, and each row was itself an array. Within each row, any unsolved cell was an array of remaining possibilities that weren&#8217;t ruled out by the column, row, or cell. With that in mind, I tried running some tests to debug my problem.</p>
<pre>@board.object_id == tempboard.object_id <br/>  =&gt; false<br/>@board[0].object_id == tempboard[0].object_id<br/>  =&gt; true</pre>
<p><span>Weird! It turns out that the <code>.dup</code> method creates a copy of the original object, but that the internal objects that the original refers to (the nested arrays, as well as the items contained therein) remained the same. Kind of boggles the mind.</span></p>
<p><span>This got me going on some other interesting equality tests (and a little bit of experimentation with the <code>.equal?</code> and <code>.eql?</code> methods):</span></p>
<pre>a = "a"<br/>  =&gt; "a"<br/>b = "a"<br/>  =&gt; "a"<br/>a == b<br/>  =&gt; true<br/>a.eql?(b)<br/>  =&gt; true<br/>a.equal?(b)<br/>  =&gt; false</pre>
<p>I actually remember encountering some (all?) of this in <em>Well-Grounded Rubyist</em>, but I&#8217;m in a much better position now to see what&#8217;s actually happening here. Both the <code>==</code> operator and <code>.eql?</code> method test for equality at the value level—if two items have the same return value, comparing them with either of these options returns true. The <code>.equal?</code> method works differently—instead of testing for return values, it tests for equality at the <em>object</em> level.</p>
<pre>"a" == "a"<br/>  =&gt; true        # obviously<br/>"a".equal?("a")<br/>  =&gt; false       # okay, sure<br/>1 == 1<br/>  =&gt; true        # totally<br/>1.equal?(1)<br/>  =&gt; true        # huh?</pre>
<p>Forgive my commentary. It&#8217;s interesting to see what&#8217;s happening here. In the first and third examples, we&#8217;re once again comparing value equality. These examples are so clearly true that they&#8217;re ringers. The second example is a little less obvious, but it makes plenty of sense—we&#8217;re testing a pair of string literals, just like if we called this:</p>
<pre>String.new.equal?(String.new)</pre>
<p>Makes sense! The last example is kind of a head-scratcher, but not impossible to wrap your mind around. Ruby treats integers as unique instances of the <code>Integer</code> class, so every 1 is the same as every other 1. On that note, instances of the <code>Integer</code> class cannot be <em>changed</em>. You can increment or replace a number, but either way you end up with a totally different object_id value—it&#8217;s the <em>fix</em> in <code>Fixnum</code>.</p>
<p>Okay, that&#8217;s enough equality for now. Going to get some sleep for a change.</p>
