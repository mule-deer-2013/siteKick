<p>An interesting thing came up while working on my Sudoku solution. Part of what I had to do to get my desired result was take my @board variable (which, you guessed it, was the instance variable that I used to change and refer to my Sudoku board) and make a copy of it. In the first part of the Sudoku challenge, since we weren&#8217;t making any changes to the Sudoku puzzle unless we were absolutely <em>certain</em> that we had the correct answer, one persistent variable for the board was all that was necessary.</p>
